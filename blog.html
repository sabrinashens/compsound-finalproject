    <p>Computer science and music both depend on a system of notations, 
      which is created to facilitate structured communication within its domain.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the class Computational Sound, 
      offered in the department of CS at Barnard Collage, 
      we’ve learned to perform and implement with live coding environments. 
      For this project, 
      I aimed to continue this and design a live coding language 
      that employs the collection of musical symbols in the realm of music.</p><br><br>

    <img src="./img/Interface.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%;">Figure 1: What's in Interface</p><br>
    <p><a href="./index.html">The Interface</a>
       has a text area where allows user to enter a space-separated list of musical symbols. 
       Each chord symbol requires the features: 
       <b>Root+Chord+Scale</b>, 
       e.g., <i>Cm9(C minor 9th) or A7(A major 7th)</i>. 
       There are some optional features following the structure 
       <b>Beats@Root+Chord+Scale’Inversion[Loops]</b>, 
       e.g., <i>4@Cm9(note length of 4), Cm9’1(first inversion), or Cm9[2](Repeats twice)</i>. 
       I will walk you through the details later. 
       Under the text area, 
       there is a slider changing the tempo of the music. 
       User can also select a waveform and at least one envelope(s) of the oscillating signal. 
       Remember to adjust the parameters before clicking “Play”! </p><br><br>

    <p style = "text-align:center">As I mentioned, the required features of each unit are <b><i>Root, Chord, and Scale. </b></i></p>

    <p style = "text-align:center"><b><i>Root</i></b> is a root key. The availble root keys are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, G, G#, A, A#, B.</p>
    <img src="./img/root.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%;">Figure 2: Piano Octave</p>

    <p style = "text-align:center"><b><i>Chord</i></b> is the chord quality. The available qualities are Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented.</p>
    <img src="./img/chord.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%">Figure 3: Chord Symbols</p>

    <p style = "text-align:center"><b><i>Scale</i></b> starts at the root and counts up until <i>n</i>th degree.</p>
    <img src="./img/scale.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%">Figure 4: Scale Symbols</p><br>

    <p style = "text-align:center">The optional features are <b><i>Beats, Inversion, and Loops.</b></i></p>
    <p style = "text-align:center"><b>Beats</b> is the note length, by entering a positive integer with @. E.g., 2@.</p>
    <img src="./img/beats.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%">Figure 5: Suggested beats</p>
    
    <p style = "text-align:center"><b>Inversion</b> is made by moving first <i>n</i> note(s) up by an octave, by entering a positive integer with '. E.g., '2.</p>
    <img src="./img/inversion.png" style="width:100%">
    <p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 80%">Figure 6: Inversion Symbols</p>

    <p style = "text-align:center"><b>Loops</b> is how many time the unit will be played, by entering [<i>n</i>], e.g., [2] means to play twice.</p>

    <h3 style = "text-align:center">Implementation: Code</h3>
    <p>If beats inputed</p>
    <p>Beats: split by @, the first element of the array</p>
    <p>If loops inputed</p>
    <p>Loops: split by [, the second element of this array, with "]"removed</p>
    <p>If inversion inputed</p>
    <p>Inversion: split by ', the second element of this array</p>
    <p>Optional features: Beats, Loops, and Inversion are either default or obtained</p>
    <p>What left is required: Root, Chord, Scale</p>
    <p>The last character of the remaining is the scale number</p>
    <p>using a math formula to convert the scale into a number of notes</p>
    <p>slice the scale number -> The root key + chord choice</p>
    <p>Take the root key and map it onto the pitch</p>
    <p>With the root pitch, extend it to the corresponding chord-scale according to its chord</p>
    <p>As we get the basic chord-scale, we start doing inversion</p>
    <p>Take the number of inversion as x, we take the values of first x element(s), then pitch+12 add to the end</p>
    <p>Then slice out the first x elements</p>
    <p>What is known now: the inverted or basic chord-scale with loops and beats if given</p>
    <p>Find each note the start time and endtime. The first note starts by the start time 0</p>
    <p>and the end time is determined by beats/tempo.</p>
    <p>diff between beats and tempo: tempo is the same for all notes, beats differ each note's length</p>
    <p>The greater beats is, the note plays slower</p>
    <p>The greater tempo is, the entire melody plays faster</p>
    <p>Then the notelist with note pitch, start time, and end time, which would be ready to play with osc</p>

    <p>How implemented</p>
    <p>Description of the sound it shapes: sustaining, rich, strong</p>

    <p>[image]</p>
    <p>How implemented</p>
    <p>Description of the sound it shapes: softer, well-shaped, lilting</p>
    <p>Users can select up to 3 envelopes</p>
    <p>used math.random to give a number, which calls a random envelope for every single note</p>
    <p>With 2 or 3 envelopes checked, the melody will sound more variable</p><br><br><br>
